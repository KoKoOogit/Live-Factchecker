Live Fact checker made by Amador Valley High School Advanced CS students!

There are currently 2 working models, each supporting a different framework

Inside the file kokooo, there is a live fact checker model that runs on a website, using microphone to capture audio, transcribe it, diarize it, and process via LLM and outside sources.

Inside the file Whisper-Live, there is a live fact checker model that runs on a chrome extention, using the same process as the 1st model.
