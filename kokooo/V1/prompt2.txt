 If the fact is not true, provide a reason why and relevant web sources to support the reason
 Ensure the output only includes false facts
 Remove any extra information

This is an example input to get you started. I would like to fact-check the following statements using the fact-checking LLM tool:

1. "I am the president of the United States in 2024."

Search Query and Fact-Checking

Here is the starting point for generating search queries and fact-checking results:

 Search query for fact 1: "Who is US president as of 2024?"
