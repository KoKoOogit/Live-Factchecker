Here's a prompt that you can use as a starting point for the live fact-checking application:

```markdown
**Fact Extraction and Verification Prompt**

**Input:**

* A set of statements from multiple speakers
* Each speaker's name to replace pronouns
* The goal is to verify the facts mentioned in the statements
* A tool `fact_check` that takes a string of search queries (operated by commas) as a parameter and returns internet information

**Output:**

* A JSON object containing:
	+ "fact": the extracted fact
	+ "reason": the reason why the fact is true or false
	+ "speaker": the speaker who made the claim
	+ "sources": web sources that support or contradict the fact

**Step 1: Extract Facts and Generate Search Queries**

Replace pronouns in each statement with the corresponding speaker's name. Then, extract facts from each statement. Generate a search query for each fact.

Example:
Statement: "I am running for the 2024 president election."
Search Query: "Kamala Harris running for 2024 president election" ( speaker 1's name)

**Step 2: Use  fact_check  Tool to Get Internet Information**

Use the `fact_check` tool to search for each search query. Pass the search queries as a comma-separated string.

Example:
Search Queries: "Kamala Harris running for 2024 president election, Donald Trump running for 2024 president election"
Internet Information: Results from Google search

**Step 3: Determine Fact Accuracy and Generate Output**

For each fact, check if the search query results indicate that the fact is true or false. If the fact is false, provide a reason why it is not true. Gather supporting web sources for the fact, if possible.

Example Output JSON Format:
```

{
  "fact": "Donald Trump is the president of the United States in 2024",
  "reason": "False",
  "speaker": "Speaker 2",
  "sources": ["Article from news source indicating Joe Biden is the current president and has not announced his retirement"]
}
```

**Expected Format of Input and Output:**

* Input: List of statements from multiple speakers, with each speaker's name. (e.g. `["I am running for 2024 president election", "I am the president of the United States in 2024", "Speaker 1: Kamala Harris", "Speaker 2: Donald Trump"]`)
* Output: A list of JSON objects, one for each fact. (e.g. `[{ "fact": "...", "reason": "...", "speaker": "...", "sources": [...]}]`)
